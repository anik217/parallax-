            Early life <br >
Anik was born in Dhaka, Bangladesh and raised in Astoria, Queens, New York. His father was involved in politics and fought in the Bangladesh Liberation War. In 1993, when Khan was four, his father moved their family to the United.
<br>
Anik moved to Leesburg, Virginia with his family in his early in high school and began spending his time making beats on FL Studio.[3] Khan described going through an identity crisis during this time, saying "I kinda didn't know who I was, I was like away from my culture". Khan later attended Full Sail University in Florida, studying recording arts engineering. While attending university, Khan would travel back to New York to record music. Khan's father and sister moved back to New York while his mother still lived in Virginia at their house, and Khan would divide his time after university living in the two states. Khan's mother would later move back to New York and live with them in LeFrak City, as they could no longer afford to live in Astoria.
<br>
In Queens, Khan would attend day parties where he met many West Indian people, which would go onto influence his music.

            About <br>
            At the very beginning of my professional carrier i was software Engineer. I did work various software projects like, Accounting, Multimedia DJ audio sound mixing software, Payroll Management, Student Security software (Hardware integrated), Bulk SMS Sending and Responding Software. <br>
            My software development platform is Microsoft Dot Net.
            But recently i change my mind to leave software development. Because i have products but if i don't sell them so there is no value at all. So i decide to be a marketing professional. I found Search Engine is one of the best sector to establish business. There is Millions of productive customer continuously searching your products.
            Now at present i am doing Search Engine Marketing and feeling much more comfortable in the SEO industry. <br>
            So my present goal is to establish my self as SEO Expet or SEO Specialist or SEO professional. In Bangladesh the industry is very new and prospective. I wish Bangladesh will be one of the best country for the SEO industry.
